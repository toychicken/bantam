	What does this do?

	# Handles some core dependencies like AJAX requests, socket connections, pub/sub and logging.
	# Loads scripts in order
	# Remembers what's initialised (so it doesn't have to be done again)
	# stores some commonly used page elements (as a shortcut, because we like compression) i.e. WIN, not window, DOC, not document etc.
