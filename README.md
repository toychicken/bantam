#BANTAM!

## What?
Bantam is my super-basic js pubsub mechanism, de-jqueried for use in any project.

## Why?
Because sometimes you don't want everything piling through a browser's DOM event model.

## Where?
You can use this on the client side, for sure.

## The Future?
I'm hoping to make this suitably robust for use in node.js too. The idea being that you'll be able to seamlessly transmit messages from front to back end, or vice versa, without worrying about where they're going. (Maybe even ability to send some messages privately?)

## Thanks
This is based on work done by Peter Higgins (dante@dojotoolkit.org), which was made known to me by the inimitable Rebecca Murphey. http://rmurphey.com/
Finally, I would not have been able to do this without the help of https://github.com/lucykav, who rocks.
